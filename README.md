# Covid-19-visualization
I learned the basics of Python programming. Our group extracted data related to COVID-19 infection numbers and conducted visual analysis and charting. This included dynamic coloring maps depicting the severity of the pandemic in different regions of China, population display charts of the pandemic in most countries around the world, and real-time line graphs of infection numbers in several provinces of China. I also created a dynamic bar chart involving over 10,000 data points, displaying the rankings of infection numbers in 25 highly populated countries from January 22, 2020, to May 24, 2021. The charts showed daily changes in infection numbers in each country, ranked by the number of cases.
